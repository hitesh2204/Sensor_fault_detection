### Scania Sensor Fault Detection project Overview.

The Scania Sensor Fault Detection Project aims to develop a fault detection system for the sensors used in Scania trucks. By analyzing sensor data, the project aims to identify faulty sensors and take appropriate actions to prevent potential failures 
.
The project involves several stages, including data preprocessing, fault detection model development, performance evaluation, and result analysis. In the data preprocessing stage, the sensor data is cleaned, missing values are handled, features are normalized, and necessary data transformations are performed. Various machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, are employed to build fault detection models. These models are trained on preprocessed data to accurately identify faulty sensors.

The performance of the fault detection models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure unbiased performance estimates. The results obtained from the fault detection models are thoroughly analyzed and interpreted to provide insights into potential improvements.

The project is focused on developing an end-to-end fault detection system that can accurately classify if the fault in the system is caused by a sensor or other components. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, the project aims to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and build a robust classification model. The model demonstrates high accuracy in the classification task, enabling businesses in the automotive industry to make informed decisions and save costs
